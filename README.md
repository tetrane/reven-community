# REVEN Community

Welcome to the official REVEN Community repository!

REVEN is a Timeless Debugging and Analysis (TDnA) Platform by [Tetrane](https://tetrane.com), that allows you to perform faster and deeper reverse engineering analysis by recording and collecting information about the execution of an entire virtual machine. [Find out more about REVEN in the documentation.](https://doc.tetrane.com/professional/latest/What-Is-REVEN.html)

This repository is meant as a place for the community of REVEN users and developers to discuss about REVEN, track the community's feature requests and issue reports, and discuss all things REVEN and Reverse Engineering related.

Besides this repository, REVEN Professional and REVEN Enterprise users have access to a dedicated support channel: [support@tetrane.com](mailto:support@tetrane.com)
